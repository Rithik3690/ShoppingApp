I am excited to have the opportunity to discuss my design and development choices for the Victoria's Secret shopping app which was built as a part of the interview round. As a developer, I believe that creating a user-friendly and visually appealing shopping app is crucial in today's market especially for a brand like Victoria's Secret.

Victoria's Secret is a well-established brand that caters to women of all ages. I choose to design and develop a shopping app for Victoria's Secret because I believe that it is essential to bring the brand's products and services to the fingertips of its customers. With a shopping app, users can easily browse through the vast collection of lingerie, sleepwear, and beauty products(i.e, perfumes for this project) that Victoria's Secret offers, which makes it convenient for users to purchase the items they desire.

Additionally, I focused on providing an excellent user experience by ensuring that the app is easy to navigate and visually engaging. By including high-quality product images, the pink color which specially describes the victoria's secret pink and astounding motion design, users can feel confident in their purchases, which leads to higher customer satisfaction.

Overall, my goal was to create an app that not only showcases Victoria's Secret's products but also provides a seamless shopping experience for its users. I am excited to discuss my design choices further and how they align with Victoria's Secret's brand image and target audience.
